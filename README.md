# Design Patterns
Design patterns are solutions to recurring problems; guidelines on how to tackle certain problems.
I have included implementations of some design patterns in C# to help beginners like me get their feet wet.
There are better alternatives available for some of them in the .NET Framework, so this is by no means a comprehensive tutorial.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome. If you want to add a new design pattern implementation, just follow the naming convention, fork my repo and submit a pull request. Same goes for any improvements and modifications.
